1. What is an open port?
Definition:
A port is a communication endpoint on a device.
An open port means that a specific service or application is actively listening for incoming network connections on that port.

Example:

Port 80 open → Web server (HTTP) is running.

Port 22 open → SSH service is running.

Key point: Open ports can be legitimate (needed for services) but can also be an entry point for attacks.

2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
Technique:
A TCP SYN scan (also called a half-open scan) sends a SYN packet to the target port:

SYN sent → Request to open a connection.

If SYN/ACK comes back → Port is open.

If RST comes back → Port is closed.

If no reply → Port is filtered (likely blocked by firewall).

Why “half-open”?
Nmap never completes the TCP handshake (it sends RST after SYN/ACK).
This is stealthier because the connection is never fully established.

3. What risks are associated with open ports?
Attack surface exposure: Attackers can find vulnerable services.

Exploitation risks:

Open port + outdated software → Remote code execution.

Weak authentication on services → Unauthorized access.

Examples:

Port 21 (FTP) with anonymous login → Free file access.

Port 445 (SMB) vulnerable to EternalBlue → Ransomware entry.

4. Difference between TCP and UDP scanning
Feature	TCP Scan	UDP Scan
Connection	Reliable, handshake-based	Connectionless
Speed	Faster & more reliable detection	Slower, prone to packet loss
Response	SYN/ACK = open, RST = closed	ICMP Port Unreachable = closed, No response = open/filtered
Use case	Web, SSH, FTP scanning	DNS, SNMP, streaming services
Nmap example	nmap -sS target	nmap -sU target

5. How can open ports be secured?
Close unnecessary ports → Disable unused services.

Use a firewall → Block or restrict inbound traffic.

Access control lists (ACLs) → Allow only trusted IPs.

Patch and update services → Prevent known exploits.

Port knocking → Open ports only after a secret “knock” sequence.

6. Firewall’s role regarding ports
Acts as a gatekeeper: Allows or blocks traffic based on rules.

Functions:

Block unused ports.

Restrict access to sensitive services.

Detect unusual scanning behavior (in some firewalls).

Example: Block all inbound except port 443 for HTTPS.

7. What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?
Definition: Sending packets to multiple ports to determine which are open.

Why attackers do it:

Reconnaissance: Identify potential attack entry points.

Service enumeration: Learn what’s running (e.g., SSH, RDP).

Exploit targeting: Match open services with known vulnerabilities.

8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
Nmap: Finds what ports are open.

Wireshark: Shows how the network responds in detail.

Benefits:

Capture and analyze SYN, SYN/ACK, RST packets from Nmap scans.

Verify firewall filtering in real-time.

Troubleshoot service communication issues.

Example:
You scan with nmap -sS and in Wireshark you see:

SYN sent → SYN/ACK back → Port open.

SYN sent → No reply → Possibly filtered.
